My project is based on games like Touhou, Bullet Hell games, where u have to shoot at an enemy shooting bullets everywhere. I've been a fan of Touhou games for years, and when I saw this project, I saw it as an opportunity to learn the efforts it takes to create.
When working on this project, I understood how hard it is to create even a boss, as well as show much thought you have to put into everything. I compared what I was doing to a full-size average of Bullet Hell Games and realized what a small portion of it I was doing,
and yet struggling with. I found a much deeper appreciation for the making of Bullet Hell games as a whole.

Despite the difficulty, I was able to implement a 3 lives system where you lose 1 life every time the player gets attacked with the enemy's bullets. This led to the implementation of hitboxes for fair treatment to the player when colliding with the enemy's bullets. If the 3 
Lives get to 0, I implemented a Game Over screen, where the player has to press "C" to continue to the start of the game. If the player won, I implemented a You win screen, and then the player can close the game.
