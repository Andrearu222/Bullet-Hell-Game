# Bullet Hell Game
https://github.com/Andrearu222/Bullet-Hell-Game.git

**Description**: My bullet hell game will display bullets the player has to dodge while shooting back at the enemy, until it's defeated. It's relevant to digital arts and media because this is an interactive piece anyone can play with a lot of creative freedom to be anything.

**Features**: cool bullet patterns, hitbox mechanics, shooting and special attack system point, and difficulty scaling when procressing enemy.

**Challenges**: Some of my challenges would be aking sure teh amount of bullets does nto affect negatively the players experience, managing collision that it's both fair and challenging, balancing a mix of game mechanics and artsitic expression with bullet patterns to make it appealing, but not too distracting.

**Outcomes**:
**Ideal outcome**: fully functioal game with custom viuals and gameplay and possible music and sound effects.

**Minimal viable outome**: a playable demo with basic movement and shooting with minimun 2 attack patterns from the enemy, as well as collision working.

**Milestones**:
Week 1: Set up pygame window, player movements, placeholders for enemy, player, and bullets sprites, and decide aesthetic.
Week 2: add player shooring functionality, bullet qualities such as speed, implement health bars and basic point system.
Week 3: implement bullet patterns and their duration, start working on the collision against the player.
Week 4: Add particles/trails for visual enhacement, work on the final sprites
Week 5: Test functionality of menu, playtest to make sure it functons and if theres no bugs if there is, make sure to fix.
